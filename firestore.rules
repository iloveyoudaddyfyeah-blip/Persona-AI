/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Character Profile Generator application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control over their own data,
 * and no user can access another user's data.  The rules are designed to be simple, secure, and
 * easy to understand.  Data validation is relaxed for prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 * Each user has a profile document and can create multiple character profiles.
 * Each character profile can have multiple chat sessions, and each chat session can have multiple chat messages.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - Users cannot list all users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  None necessary, path-based ownership is sufficient.
