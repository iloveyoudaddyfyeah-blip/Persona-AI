/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control over their own data tree,
 * and no user can access another user's data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Data is nested under `/users/{userId}`, reflecting a clear ownership hierarchy. Character profiles,
 * chat sessions, and chat messages are all subcollections of the user's document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All write operations are protected by authorization checks to prevent unauthorized data modification.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset relies on path-based ownership, so no additional denormalization is required. The `userId`
 * is already present in the path for all user-owned data.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * All user-specific data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring clear segregation and preventing
 * accidental exposure of private data.
