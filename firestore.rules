/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the character-profile application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control
 * over their own data, and no other user can access it. This applies to user profiles,
 * character profiles, chat sessions, and chat messages.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore data is organized hierarchically under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}: Stores character profiles created by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}/chatSessions/{chatSessionId}: Stores chat sessions for a specific character profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}/chatSessions/{chatSessionId}/chatMessages/{chatMessageId}: Stores chat messages for a specific chat session.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are only accessible and modifiable by the owning user.
 * - Character profiles, chat sessions, and chat messages are also only accessible and modifiable by the owning user through path-based ownership.
 * - No listing of users is allowed to prevent information disclosure.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `userId` is present in all documents nested under `/users/{userId}`. This redundancy simplifies
 *    the security rules and avoids the need for complex queries.
