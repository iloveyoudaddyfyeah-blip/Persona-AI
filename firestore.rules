/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}: Character profiles created by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}/chatSessions/{chatSessionId}: Chat sessions for a specific character profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}/chatSessions/{chatSessionId}/chatMessages/{chatMessageId}: Chat messages for a specific chat session.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All data is nested under /users/{userId}, enforcing a 1:N relationship between users and their data.
 * - Only authenticated users can access data, and only their own data.
 * - Listing of users is not allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Each document contains a 'userId' field that is validated against the path to ensure ownership.
