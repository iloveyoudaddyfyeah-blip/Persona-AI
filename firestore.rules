/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}: Stores character profiles created by each user.
 * - /users/{userId}/personas/{personaId}: Stores user-created personas.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed.
 * - All write operations are validated against the authenticated user's ID.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   - Each document stored under a user path inherently has the userId for authorization.
