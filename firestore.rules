/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the character profile application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control over their own data,
 * including their profile, character profiles, chat sessions, and chat messages. No data is publicly accessible,
 * and cross-user access is explicitly denied.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically under the /users/{userId} collection. Each user has a document
 * containing their profile information. Under each user, there are collections for characters, chat sessions,
 * and chat messages, all nested to ensure clear ownership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled to prevent enumeration attacks.
 * - All write operations are validated against the authenticated user's ID.
 * - No schema validation is performed beyond ownership checks to allow for rapid prototyping.
 * - The rules are designed to be highly readable and maintainable, with complex logic abstracted into helper functions.
