/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user can only
 *              access and modify their own data, stored under their unique user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user-specific data, including settings and active persona.
 * - /users/{userId}/personas/{personaId}: Stores user-created personas.
 * - /characterProfiles/{characterProfileId}: Stores character profiles, publicly readable but owner-writable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own profiles and personas.
 * - Character profiles are publicly readable to facilitate discovery but writable only by the owner.
 * - User listing is explicitly disallowed for privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `id` field in `User` documents MUST match the `userId` in the path `/users/{userId}`. This is enforced on creation and maintained immutably on updates.
 * - The `id` field in `UserPersona` documents MUST be present on creation.
